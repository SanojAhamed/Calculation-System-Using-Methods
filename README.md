# Calculation-System-Using-Methods
In our project we created a Calculation system using Methods in Java

This is Our 1st Year 2nd Semester Mini Java Group Project.The project is regarding a "Calculation System using methods".In this system, user can enter the inputs and the system will calculate and display the perfect output within a short time period.This makes the system a user-friendly manner. 

# Here we used Ten types of Methods in Java. And we Named that as,

1. Largest
2. Largest Pro
3. Square root
4. Multiplication table
5. Multiplication table Pro
6. Find ( odd / even )
7. Student marks
8. EPF 
9. ETF
10. Employee details

We named our project "Calculation System Using Methods".That allows any person (children & Adults) to use and get accurate solutions for mathematical problems and can get employee's salary details in the companies with advanced technologies.

Users can input some/multiple numbers and get the results as the Largest number, Smallest number, Is it odd or even number, multiplication tables, square roots of the numbers, Average results of the students, EPF, ETF, and Allowance of the employees.

Here we used methods in Java to make our project. A method in Java is a collection of statements that perform some specific task and return the result to the caller. A Java method can perform some specific task without returning anything. It allows us to reuse the code without retyping the code. So it is easier too. Where ever we want to call something, we can use the method and we don't want to write code again and again. Just we can write the method name and can call it. It will work perfectly.The method increases the reusability of the code thus also reducing the size of the code and complex problems can be modularized with the help of the method.

In case code is written without using the method, it will grow very large in size and thus would also become difficult to test, debug and maintain the code. The method makes the program well structured. It provides an effective way for the user to reuse the existing code and optimizes the execution time and memory space. So it is very helpful for our coding. 

# Methods  Explanation 

These are the methods we used in our program.

● Largest -  Here we used the Largest method name to find the largest number in the set of numbers.

● Largest Pro -  These are used to find in the set of numbers which one is the largest number and which one is the smallest number.

● Square root -  This is used to find the square root of the number.

● Multiplication table -  Here user can input a number and can find the Multiplication table of that number.

● Multiplication table Pro -  Here users can input multiple numbers and can get output as many multiplication tables as/ how many rows they want to get.

● Find (odd/even ) -  Here user can find the odd numbers and the even numbers separately.

● Student marks -  Here user can find the average of the student. We used some conditions to find the results of the students.

● EPF - It's used to find the EPF of the employees. It means 12 percent of the employee's income.

● ETF - It's used to find the ETF of the employees. It means 4 percent of the employee's income.

● Employee detals -  Here user can count the amount of the total income (salary), Allowance, and EPFof the employee.


# Conclusion 

This project will help to the user who wants to work easily with the less time. It will provide the perfect output to the user. It's more trustable results. Here we used Methods for create this Calculation system. Methods are rime savers and help us to reuse the code without retyping the code. Method is a block of code which only runs when it is called. We can pass data, known as parameters, into a method. So, then the user will get more benefits using this Calculation system. And (children to adults) everyone can use this system very easily. It will be more helpful for their day to day mathematical works and find solutions, collectingdata within few seconds. So, they don't want to spent more time for their work.
